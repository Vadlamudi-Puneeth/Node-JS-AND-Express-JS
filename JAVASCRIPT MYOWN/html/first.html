      <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
      <p>
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer 
        Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose 
        from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character 
        with whom teens could identify. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an 
        opportunity to “get out of his system” what he felt was missing in comic books. 
        In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the 
        Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, 
        Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in 
        his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of 
        whether or not this is true.
